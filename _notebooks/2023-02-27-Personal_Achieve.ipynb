    "Another way I grew from this project was learning how to debug through alerts and ultimately just creating better coding habits. I have learned not to just paste random segments of code that I find on the internet and hope it does what I want it to do. Instead, I analyze what the code I find is doing and try to replicate it to fit my own needs. And if it doesn't work, I can use alerts in my code to see what part of my code or what functions are actually running and what aren't so I know where something might have gone wrong and what I have to fix. I have also been trying to pay more attention to simple things like the indentations in my code and adding comments which can actually make a big difference when showing my code to others and it also helps me when I am looking through my code trying to debug.
