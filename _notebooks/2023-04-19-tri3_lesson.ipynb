    "In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'MPG' column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the 'MPG' column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently"

    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    "1. **What is NumPy and how is it used in data analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python library used for scientific computing and data analysis that provides  multidimensional array objects, various derived objects, and functions for working with these arrays. NumPy is used for mathematical and statistical operations on arrays which is helpful for data analysis, scientific research, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is Pandas and how is it used in data analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis that provides two data structures, Series and DataFrame, for handling structured data. Pandas is used for reading and writing data in various formats, cleaning data, merging and joining datasets, and performing statistical analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How is NumPy different than Pandas for data analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy and Pandas are both used for data analysis, but NumPy is primarily used for numerical operations on arrays, whereas Pandas is used for handling structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is a DataFrame?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas that consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type. (like excel spreadsheets)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are some common operations you can perform with NumPy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating arrays\n",
    "- Indexing arrays\n",
    "- Performing mathematical operations\n",
    "- summarizing data\n",
    "- Sorting and searching arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How can you incorporate either of these data analysis tools (NumPy, Pandas) into your project?**\n",
    "I can use pandas to compare and summarize the cycle lengths of the users to make conclusions such as, what is the average cycle length of my users.\n"
