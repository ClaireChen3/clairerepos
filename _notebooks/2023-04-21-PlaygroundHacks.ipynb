    "    - Spreadsheet software: Spreadsheets are often organized as a 2D arrays for a modern-day game that could be classified as a 2D array, a good example would be the popular puzzle game \"Sudoku\". In Sudoku, the game board is represented as a 9x9 grid of cells, with each cell containing a number from 1 to 9. The game involves filling in the missing numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid, following certain rules. The game board can be easily represented as a 2D array in programming, with each cell being an element in the array.y of cells, where each cell has a row and column index.\n",

    "- Explain how the tic tac toe game works\n",
    "    - The game is played on a 3x3 board represented by a nested list called 'board'. The 'print_board()' function prints the current state of the board, showing the row and column indices and the symbols ('X' or 'O') that have been placed on the board. The 'check_win(player)' function checks if the player who made the move has won the game. It checks for winning combinations on the rows, columns, and diagonals of the board. The 'check_tie()' function checks if the game is a tie. If all the spaces on the board have been filled and no player has won, the game is a tie. The 'play_game()' function starts the game loop. It initializes the player to 'X' and the turn counter to 0. In each iteration of the loop, it prints the current state of the board, prompts the player for their move, checks if the move is valid, updates the board, checks if the player has won or the game is a tie, switches to the other player if the game is not over, and repeats the loop. Finally, the 'play_game()' function is called to start the game. It prints the initial state of the board and starts the game loop until a winner is found or the game ends in a tie.\n",
