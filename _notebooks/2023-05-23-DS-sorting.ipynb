    "- Now it's time to do some coding...\n",

    "- Run code and then research and answer these questions...\n",
    "    - Is a list and/or dictionary in python considered a primitive or collection type?  Why?<br>\n",
    "    In Python, a list and a dictionary are considered collection types rather than primitive types. This is because they can hold multiple values or elements of different data types, making them more complex and versatile than primitive types. Lists are ordered collections that allow indexing and slicing operations, while dictionaries are unordered collections that store key-value pairs for efficient access to values. \n",
    "    - Is the list passed into bubble sort \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output.<br>\n",
    "    The list passed into the bubbleSort function is pass-by-reference. In Python, objects, including lists, are passed by reference when used as function arguments. When a list is passed as an argument to the bubbleSort function, it is passed by reference, meaning modifications made to the list within the function affect the original list outside. The bubbleSort function sorts the list in-place by swapping elements, and these modifications directly impact the original list. This demonstrates that the list is indeed passed by reference, allowing the function to modify the original list directly.\n",

    "- Implement new cell(s) and/or organize cells to do the following.\n",
    "    - Create your own list\n",
    "    - Use your expertise sorting algorithm (selection, insertion, merge). Note, I got my bubble sort from Geek for Geeks and made modifications. Each student in a group should have a unique algorithm.\n",
    "    - Test your list with my bubble sort\n",
    "    - Test my list with your new sort\n",
    "    - Research analysis on sorting: comparisons, swaps, time.  Build this into your hacks.\n",
    "    - Find a better way to print the data, key first, then other elements in viewable form.\n",
