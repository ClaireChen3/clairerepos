<li>computers used to be really big but got progressively smarter</li>
<li>computers send and receive data</li>
<li>computers understand electrons represented by numbers "talk number" </li>
<li>we have to translate our information into numbers and packets</li>
<li>packets: small amount of data sent over a network<ul>
<li>packet includes source and destination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>creation of computer systems <ul>
<li>computer systems are groups of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>computer network is a group of computing devices that send and receive data</li>
<li>router helps with packet switching (guides message from sender to receiver)<ul>
<li>Packet: message that is broken up into packets and sent in any order</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bandwidth: maximum amount of data that can be sent in an amount of time(bits per second)<ul>
<li>the more data the slower it might take to get from sender to receiver (like traffic)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Video-2">Video 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Video-2"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>computer protocol (rules of the road)</li>
<li>computer protocol models<ul>
<li>OSI</li>
<li>TCP<ul>
<li>layers you have to go through to communicate (7 layers of protocol)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>layer 1: Network Acess layer<ul>
<li>ex. wifi card</li>
<li>deliver packets from one network interface card (NIC) to another aka "hop"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>layer 2: Internet Layer Data Transmission<ul>
<li>a packet contains data that is being transimitted and metadata(information for routing messages)</li>
<li>one device with a certain IP address is sending a message on on that path, they run into routers that help guide them to the IP address of the other device the message is trying to reach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>layer 3: Transport Layer<ul>
<li>TCP slower but reliable</li>
<li>UDP faster but does not guarantee transfers</li>
<li>computer is sending IP addresses through bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>layer 4: Application Layer<ul>
<li>DNS (domain name service), human language to IP address</li>
<li>web servers are programs running on machines connected to internet</li>
<li>www (world wide web) is a network of linked programs and data running over the internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>http is a protocol used by world wide web</li>
<li>routes are flexible</li>
<li>world wide web is not the internet</li>
</ul>
