- until count is greater than max, that means it will print all numbers less than or equal to max

- The Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.

- overflow error will occur because SUM of 14 and 15 is larger than the largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits which is 1111

- 4 bits can be represented as 2^4=16, which means 4 bits can store 16 pieces of information, only 8 pieces of information has to be stored, so 4 bits is enough

- first 4 is assigning variables, after those four lines, values are reassigned
- p becomes 20, q becomes 30, s becomes 20, r becomes 20

- Since num1 is not less than num2, num3 becomes 4, 
- Since num2 is greater than or equal to num3, num1 becomes 8
- So, num1 + num2 + num3 = 8 + 4 + 4 =16

- The variables x and result are initialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop terminates when x exceeds 5. Therefore, result is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15.

- count1 adds 1 for each positive value and count2 adds 1 for every negative or 0 value

- the first two lines are assigning the value true to "first" and the value false to "second", the next two are reassigning values
- "second" becomes true, "first" becomes true

- similar to 46, the first three lines are assigning values to the variables, 
then for every next line, it is reassigning the values
- so x becomes 50, y becomes 75, and z becomes 50.
