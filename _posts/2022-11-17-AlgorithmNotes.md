<h4 id="3.9-Video-1">3.9 Video 1<a class="anchor-link" href="#3.9-Video-1"> </a></h4><p>What I need to cover in this lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing</li>
<li>However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result</li>
<li>Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem</li>
<li>Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent boolean expressions</li>
</ul>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<ul>
<li>something as minor as writing a &gt; instead of a &gt;= can change the result of an entire algorithm (differentiate 2 algorithms)<ul>
<li>create two algorithms that look similar but display different results for example</li>
<li>assign fixing one of the algorithms to have both results be the same for homework</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if else conditionals can be replaced by boolean expression<ul>
<li>create an if else statement and two boolean expressions to go with it (one that has the same result as the if else statement and one that doesn't)</li>
<li>assigning blogging about which boolean expression can replace the if then statement and why</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>explain how being able to spot these differences in algorithms will be important to us<ul>
<li>assign blogging about how they will use knowledge about algorithms to work on team projects in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
