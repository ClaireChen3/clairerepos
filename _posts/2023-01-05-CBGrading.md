<p>Review the score given by the AP scorers and reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring
<br>For the fist submission, I got confused with the purpose and function so I checked it off on the checklist, but then I realized what the difference between purpose and function was and graded the second one properly</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>have a user input</li>
<li>have an out put</li>
<li>preferably have something that shows the process of how the input resulted in the output</li>
<li>have a clear and detailed description of the function (what the program is doing)</li>
<li>have a clear and detailed description of the purpose (the general goal/ why you made the program)</li>
<li>describe the input that was inputed in the demonstration video and what happens to it in order to get the output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard
<br>The first submission didn't meet the standard because their descriptions for everything could've been a lot more detailed and they probably got confused on the difference between a function and a purpose like I did and just put the function, so they didn't get the point for the missing purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
