<p>I will probably use the user sign in for my create performance task as it uses lists and shows a connection between the frontend and backend. I plan to show the input and output of the symptoms checklist and describe the purpose and the function like I did in this weeks presentation. I will show data storage through a list in the backend. This data will then be used to predict symptoms for each day of the user's period or cycle. Show and describe the function I made for the symptoms checklist and where is is called. Explain how the checklist function uses sequencing, selection, and iteration. Describe the conditions that the function is testing and the result of that.
