Explain how the tic tac toe game works The game is played on a 3x3 board represented by a nested list called &#39;board&#39;. The &#39;print_board()&#39; function prints the current state of the board, showing the row and column indices and the symbols (&#39;X&#39; or &#39;O&#39;) that have been placed on the board. The &#39;check_win(player)&#39; function checks if the player who made the move has won the game. It checks for winning combinations on the rows, columns, and diagonals of the board. The &#39;check_tie()&#39; function checks if the game is a tie. If all the spaces on the board have been filled and no player has won, the game is a tie. The &#39;play_game()&#39; function starts the game loop. It initializes the player to &#39;X&#39; and the turn counter to 0. In each iteration of the loop, it prints the current state of the board, prompts the player for their move, checks if the move is valid, updates the board, checks if the player has won or the game is a tie, switches to the other player if the game is not over, and repeats the loop. Finally, the &#39;play_game()&#39; function is called to start the game. It prints the initial state of the board and starts the game loop until a winner is found or the game ends in a tie. | . | Give 3 Examples of games that can be made from 2D arrays . Tic-Tac-Toe: A 2D array can represent a 3x3 grid for the game, with each element storing a value (&#39;X&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, or empty) for the current state of the game. . | Minesweeper: A 2D array can represent a grid for the game, with each element storing a value (mine or not, covered or uncovered) for the state of each cell. . | Sokoban: A 2D array can represent a grid for the game, with each element representing a tile. The player and boxes can be separate objects that move around the grid, with the state of the game updated by checking for collisions and events. . | . | . List and Dictionaries 0.2 (can get up to 0.23) .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is . | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # it is in dictionary format # it gets rid of all duplicates # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # because it organizes data # they both can&#39;t have collisions . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

Reflect: I find this panel to be very inspiring because the stress of college applications and decisions has been getting to me recently. I have also been feeling pressured to get into prestigious colleges like UCs because I feel like that is the only way I will get good opportunities and a good job in the future. However, this panel proved me wrong. They offers so many courses and programs, as well as clubs and other resources that I feel like could really help me have a good college experience and get me a job I enjoy. Ashley, one of the speakers, also said some inspiring things, like how failure is normal and doesn&#39;t define you. Lastly, the activity at the end was very fun. .",

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls, cd, rm-rf . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? dir, rmdir, mkdir&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; What are some of the major differences? the differences between windows and linux the dir command vs the ls, they both list &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? you have to identify which file the image is in. It is especially important when you want to edit the image&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? metadata is the information embeded in a image file. and the labeling is used to assign descriptive tags to certain files to help identify and classify them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython is a command shell for interactive computing that is now known as jupyter notebook. It is interesting for pandas and images because it helps us to express the metadata from the images into a datastructure(table) so that we can analyze or change it. . | &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Claire Chen&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Base64 represents the most characters as it represents letters, numbers, and some symbols. Binary only does 0 or 1 and hexadecimals only 16 digits (0-9-A-F)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. The Base64 encoding of &quot;cla&quot; is &quot;Y2xh&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? when logging into synergy, it buffers during the sign in | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? it is kind of annoying because you have to wait for it to load to do whatever it is you&#39;re trying to do | How do these effects apply to images? these affects apply to images because when loading images the buffer depends on how big the file is. Usually lossy files take a shorter time to load because it is compressed which makes the file smaller. | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? yes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? It converts a color image into a grayscale by taking the average of the red, green, and blue values of each pixel in the color image and setting the resulting value as the new gray value for that pixel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? Scaling an image is when you resize it by a certain factor horizontaly and/or vertically . The scale factor has to be greater than 1 to make the image bigger, but less than 1 to shrink the image. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? scaling an image is not a type of compression because although it reduces the size of the image itself, it doesn&#39;t reduce the amount of data in that image or reduce the actual file size. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Claire Chen&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Smiley Face Claire Chen PNG RGBA Original size: (1200, 1200) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

            "content": "Personally, I progressed more in my frontend coding skills with learning how to debug, add style, and make functions, but I also learned and struggled a lot about backend coding and how classes/objects are used to store things in a database as well as things like methods and innerHTML . Create (post) . def post(self): &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate comment (makes sure it is more than two characters) comment = body.get(&#39;comment&#39;) if comment is None or len(comment) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Comment is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 # validate symptom (makes sure it is more than two characters) symptom = body.get(&#39;symptom&#39;) if symptom is None or len(symptom) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Symptom is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = Symptom(comment=comment, symptom=symptom) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create comment in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of comment if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {comment}, either a format error or {symptom} is duplicate&#39;}, 400 . I used selection to test the conditions of the comment and symptom(inputs) to make sure there is no garbage going in like repetitions and comments or symptoms that are less than to characters. I used the things we learned from class like if then statements, len(), return, condition. The second chunk of code is adding the comment to the database which can then be accessed from frontend. . // URL for Create API // Fetch API call to the database to create a new comment fetch(create_fetch, requestOptions) .then(response =&gt; { // trap error response from Web API if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database create error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // response contains valid result response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); //add a table row for the new/created userid //add_row(data); }) }) . In frontend, I fetched the API from the backend and added the data in the database to the table in the frontend as rows. . Create (get) . class _Read(Resource): def get(self): users = Symptom.query.all() # read/extract all comments from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps . This backend code gets the data from the database through &quot;query&quot; and outputs it in json through &quot;jsonify&quot; . // Display User Table, data is fetched from Backend Database function read_users() { // prepare fetch options const read_options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; } } . Now in fronted I use the get method to fetch the data. Now frontend and backend are connected through POST and GET! . Reflection: . Though challenging, I do realize that backend coding is arguably one of the most crucial parts of building a website and my experience with backend coding and the skills I am just starting to learn will get better and more applicable as I continue to code in the future. .",

One of my personal Achievements when working on Flow with my group was learning how to debug my code and getting a lot of practice on writing functions(especially iterations). For one of the features in my Symptom tab, I made a checklist that gives you the link to the part of the page that shows the remedies to the symptoms you&#39;ve checked off in the checklist after pressing the &quot;See Remedies To&quot; button. See function below . // this function hides all the links at first fHide(); function fHide() { for (var i =1; i &lt;12;i++){ document.getElementById(&quot;s&quot;+ i).style.visibility = &quot;hidden&quot;; } } // when this function is called, it will display the remedies to the symptoms that have been checked function fDisplay() { for (var i =1; i &lt;12;i++) if (document.getElementById(&quot;chk&quot;+ i).checked==true){ document.getElementById(&quot;s&quot;+ i).style.visibility = &quot;&quot;; } else{ document.getElementById(&quot;s&quot;+ i).style.visibility = &quot;hidden&quot;; } } . The first function &quot;fHide&quot; hides all the hyperlinks when you first click on the page by using a for loop to go through all the hyperlinks and changing their visibility to hidden. Then the second function &quot;fDisplay&quot; also uses a for loop that goes through the checklist and looks for the ones that are checked. If it is checked, then it will change the visibility from hidden to not hidden, but if it is not checked, it will remain hidden. Though this may not seem really advanced, for me, writing a function from scratch and using sequencing, selection, and iteration to accomplish my goals is already a pretty big improvement. However, I hope to continue to improve my coding skills and be able to write more concise code. . Another way I grew from this project was learning how to debug through alerts and ultimately just creating better coding habits. I have learned not to just paste random segments of code that I find on the internet and hope it does what I want it to do. Instead, I analyze what the code I find is doing and try to replicate it to fit my own needs. And if it doesn&#39;t work, I can use alerts in my code to see what part of my code or what functions are actually running and what aren&#39;t so I know where something might have gone wrong and what I have to fix. I have also been trying to pay more attention to simple things like the indentations in my code and adding comments which can actually make a big difference when showing my code to others and it also helps me when I am looking through my code trying to debug. .",

We let them use our symptoms feature which gave them remedies and products for your symptoms and also let them take a quiz to test their knowledge on periods. Then we walked around and looked at other groups websites. One of the websites that caught my attention was bria&#39;s friend website because the user interface was really pretty and comfortable to use and also I have never thought of making a social website that you can connect with people on (kind of like social media) and I thought it was a really good idea. Claire Zhao and I also went to see the digital animation exhibits which were all really cool and looked pretty realistic. Claire is posing with one of the donuts in this picture but the ones I loved the most were the interior design and house ones. Something like that could definitely be useful to designing an actually home or any place. lastly, we walked down to the ceramics class to see some cool pieces and sculptures that students have made. My favorite one was this turtle because I really liked how detailed it is and also the colors and how their blended. I also like how it is also a teapot because you can use it as a teapot but also as a decoration when you&#39;re not using it as a teapot. . Overall, night at the museum started a little stressful, but in the end, things ended up going pretty well, and it was really fun to see what other students from other classes have been working on .",

Facebook&#39;s audience is typically 25-34 years old while Tiktok&#39;s audience is 13-17 years old. There&#39;s no purposeful exclusion because the apps don&#39;t exclude anyone, but people of different ages and generations choose to use certain apps.

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). .

(.25) . (Extra credit: If your code is more efficient it will recieve a higher grade.) . | . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment for Algorithm Efficiency .

Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . when 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. - just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things:) . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Do Better . Why is this important? When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . Hacks: . Make your own version of this! requirements: . main goal of algorithm | main/base algorithm (ideal algorithm) | an algorithm that visual looks like the first one but is flawed, has a different result, or both explain the flaw either in notes of your code or in a markdown | . | an algorithm that looks very different from first algorithm but has some result/ solves the same problem explanation/ comparison of this algorithm with the first one | . | . The Algorithms don&#39;t have to be super complicated! But it should be complex enough to show a good understanding of this lesson as well as previous ones . Scoring Rubric: . 0.05 for an interesting goal | 0.05 for a well completed main algorithm | 0.05 for algorithm that looks the same but is different | 0.05 for algorithm that looks different but is the same | 0.05 for explanation of both algorithms above | total: 0.25 | . Extra things to add to notes:) . why having this understanding of algorithms is important to you as a coder | .",

Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API. This is how data transports over the internet in a &quot;JSON&quot; text form # - The JSON &quot;text&quot; is formed in dictionary {} and list [] divisions # - To read the result, Data Scientist of Developer converts JSON into human readable form # - Review the first line, look for the keys -- &quot;status&quot; and &quot;data&quot; . {&#34;message&#34;:&#34;You are not subscribed to this API.&#34;} . Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) . JSON data is Python type: &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above? {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You are not subscribed to this API.&#39;} . Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",
