            "content": "Section 3.14.1 - Libraries (Ethan Tran) . Learning Objective . To be able to select appropriate libraries and/or existing code to use in the creation of new programs. . College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange. How can you simulate this situation using a random number generator. . | Also answer this question: What numbers can be outputted from RANDOM(12,20) and what numbers are excluded? . | .

Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

Q: How many ways are there to peel a banana? Is the result the same? . Main Idea 1: . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples! . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Nice! . yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . when 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. - just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things:) . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Do Better . Why is this important? When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . Hacks: . Make your own version of this! requirements: . main goal of algorithm | main/base algorithm (ideal algorithm) | an algorithm that visual looks like the first one but is flawed, has a different result, or both explain the flaw either in notes of your code or in a markdown | . | an algorithm that looks very different from first algorithm but has some result/ solves the same problem explanation/ comparison of this algorithm with the first one | . | . The Algorithms don&#39;t have to be super complicated! But it should be complex enough to show a good understanding of this lesson as well as previous ones .

            "content": "Python, RapidAPI Terms . APIs and tooling like Jupyter docs allows many opportunities in fields like Data Science. As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests url = &quot;https://google-translate1.p.rapidapi.com/language/translate/v2/detect&quot; payload = &quot;q=English%20is%20hard%2C%20but%20detectably%20so&quot; headers = { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;, &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: &quot;application/gzip&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;cfb16a4106mshdbb9be413abfd1dp1aef68jsn13566184f01a&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;google-translate1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;POST&quot;, url, data=payload, headers=headers) print(response.text) . {&#34;data&#34;:{&#34;detections&#34;:[[{&#34;confidence&#34;:1,&#34;language&#34;:&#34;en&#34;,&#34;isReliable&#34;:false}]]}} . Digital Coin Example . This example provides digital coin feedback (ie Bitcoin). It include popularity, price, symbols, etc. . A valid X-RapidAPI-Key is required. Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API.

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) . JSON data is Python type: &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above? {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You are not subscribed to this API.&#39;} . Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",
