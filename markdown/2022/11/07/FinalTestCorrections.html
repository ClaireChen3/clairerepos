<ul>
  <li>needs location to find restaurants near them, only Alejandra’s contact list is needed because shes the one hosting it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>until count is greater than max, that means it will print all numbers less than or equal to max</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q18.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q19.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>overflow error will occur because SUM of 14 and 15 is larger than the largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits which is 1111</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q20.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>4 bits can be represented as 2^4=16, which means 4 bits can store 16 pieces of information, only 8 pieces of information has to be stored, so 4 bits is enough</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q41.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>first 4 is assigning variables, after those four lines, values are reassigned</li>
  <li>p becomes 20, q becomes 30, s becomes 20, r becomes 20</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q42.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since num1 is not less than num2, num3 becomes 4,</li>
  <li>Since num2 is greater than or equal to num3, num1 becomes 8</li>
  <li>So, num1 + num2 + num3 = 8 + 4 + 4 =16</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q43.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>The variables x and result are initialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop terminates when x exceeds 5. Therefore, result is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q45.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>count1 adds 1 for each positive value and count2 adds 1 for every negative or 0 value</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q46.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>the first two lines are assigning the value true to “first” and the value false to “second”, the next two are reassigning values</li>
  <li>“second” becomes true, “first” becomes true</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/clairerepos/images/Q48.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>similar to 46, the first three lines are assigning values to the variables, 
then for every next line, it is reassigning the values</li>
  <li>so x becomes 50, y becomes 75, and z becomes 50.</li>
</ul>
